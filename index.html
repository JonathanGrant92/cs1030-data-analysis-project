		<h2>Data Set Description</h2>
		<figure>
			<blockquote cite="https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/hads/hads.html">
				<p>The Housing Affordability Data System (HADS) is a set of files derived from the 1985 and later national American Housing Survey (AHS) and the 2002 and later Metro AHS. This system categorizes housing units by <em>affordability and households by income</em>, with respect to the <em>Adjusted Median Income, Fair Market Rent (FMR), and poverty income</em>. It also includes <em>housing cost burden</em> for owner and renter households. These files have been the basis for the worst case needs tables since 2001. The data files are available for public use, since they were derived from AHS public use files and the published income limits and FMRs. We are providing these files give the community of housing analysts the opportunity to use a consistent set of affordability measures.</p>

			<h3>Steps</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Discovered data from a data.gov <a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/housing-affordability-data-system-hads">entry</a> by file type and category (csv format and economic issues).</li>
				<li>Analysed synopsis of data set for keywords, which led to observations and inquiries.</li>
				<li>Downloaded and skimmed HADS documentation, which led to revisions of inquiries.</li>
				<li>Downloaded and opened the ASCII version zip for 2013</li>
				<li>Attempted to import file into Google sheets, but the csv file is 53 mb.</li>
				<li>Opened csv file in gedit and libreoffice calc; there are 64,535 records with 73 fields per record.
					<br>Queue time to think about best approaches with a moderately sized data set; options include:
					<ul>
						<li>office software like libre office calc</li>
						<li>a database management system like libreoffice base or mysql</li>
						<li>an object relational model like jpa coupled with hibernate in Java</li> 
					</ul>
					To address inquiries:
					<ul>
						<li>Records need to be filtered by values of several metrics.</li>
						<li>Values should be plotted on a graph to visualize relationships.</li>
					</ul>
					So, office software like libre office calc would be useful. However, mysql workbench is more familiar for querying data sets. Therefore, a combination of mysql workbench and libre office calc is desirable.
				</li>
				<li>Created a second sheet in Calc for data analysis.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Created a legend of relevants of fields.</li>
						<li>Counted and averaged records by relevant fields using built-in functions.</li>
						<li>Sorted and counted different renter codes and display as a pie chat</li>
					</ul>
				<li>Explored Tableau as an option.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Uploaded dataset csv file to a workbook.</li>
						<li>Set BURDEN and ZINC2 as y and x axis, and filtered out records with default and negative values.</li>
						<li>Customized graph with axis titles, scales and color.</li>
						<li>Downloaded graph as an image for project.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>Analysed results and formed conclusion></li>

			<h3>Statistics</h3>
			<img src="images/thads2013n-stats.png">
			<p>The average of median area income is $68,110. The fair market rent average is $1,164. The average poverty income level is $15,987. The average annual household income is $61,536. The average monthly housing cost is $1061.61 or $12,739.36 annually. Note that the housing cost is approximately 79.69% of the average poverty income level.<br>Burden is a housing cost metric determined by the division of monthly housing cost over monthly income for a record (<a href="#hads">HADS</a>: 5).</p>

			<hr>
			<h3>Renter Types</h3>
			<img src="images/proportionality-tenures.png" width="500">
			<p>Approximate 55% of records indicate home ownership. The remaining records indicate renters of three categories of units; apartments, houses, and not specified.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>Burden to Income Correlation?</h3>
			<img src="images/housing-cost-burden-over-monthly-income-graph.png" width="500">
			<p>Monthly household income is negatively correlated to the housing cost burden of households. The relationship approximates the positive x-axis of the parent function x^-2. The housing cost burden is the quadratic reciprocal of your household income. The less income you earn is quadratically related to your housing burden; burden increase steepens with less income.</p>
		</section>
		<hr>
		<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
		<section>
			<p>The analysis and visuals of burden cost over monthly income answers the first inquiry. There exists a strong negative correlation between housing cost burden and a household's income. So, households below the poverty line carry a disproportionate share of the nation's housing burden.</p>
